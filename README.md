# BroadCastChannelTicTacToe
You need to open two tabs that share the same domain, open devtools on both tabs and paste in the script into the console. This allows you to play tictactoe where one tab is Player O and the other tab is Player X. Once a player wins, you need to refresh both tabs to restart the game. with a good setup it is fun to play in co-op.
